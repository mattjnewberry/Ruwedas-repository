    review: " 1 star : Nice setting on golfcourt,nice zen garden,first impression was ok,not more,but outdated rooms with poor service in general,food(very basic breakfast ,drinks,service takes very long time)really not 5 star hotel (February 2022)",
    review2:"5 star : As you enter the Amanjena hotel, you feel the warmth of the place, and this is what made us visit it several times. Everything about it makes you feel proud to have visited a place like Amanjena.But this time we met a nice guy Kamal, who is a cheerful, wonderful and talented professional in the Moroccan restaurant, whom we thank very much for receiving us so graciously, rarely find people like him. In fact, Amanjena Hotel is one of the best hotels have visited so far (June 2022 )",
